Please adhere to the following guidelines:
1) Do not repeat questions.
2) Ensure your questions are relevant to both the given question and context.
3) Generate a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 4 questions.
4) Your questions should explore the topic in depth, based on the given question.
5) The output should be a list of questions.
6) The questions should be likely to be asked by a human, given the context and question.
7) The questions MUST be relevant to the CONTEXT.
8) Be specific to the given context in your questions.
9) Avoid vague language in your questions. Be specific and direct.

For example:
Given question: "What is the purpose of this code?"
Given context: "Assume, This is a code file that contains a class that is used to create a new user.(In reality it will be code)"
Output: ["What is a class?", "How does one create a new class?", "What is the purpose of a class?", "How does this code manage users?"]

4) 'search results': the results from a web search of the 'question' related to 'context'.

- Use the conversation history to provide contextually relevant responses.
- Aim for an output length of around 400 words, although this is not a strict limit.
- You may use the provided references in your final output if necessary.
